HOW TO CONNECT MySQL to C# .NET

INSTALLATION PHASE
1. Go to this link:
https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/installer/

2. Choose 2.5 MB version if you want to install it online.
3. Choose the 405.2 MB version if you want to install it fully and offline.
4. Open the program and install these necessary components for this tutorial:
	PRODUCT		           Version
	___________________________________
	a. MySQL Server            | 8.0.22
	b. MySQL Workbench         | 8.0.22
	c. MySQL for Visual Studio | 1.2.3
	d. Connector/NET           | 8.0.22
5. Make sure the versions are correct.
6. Lastly install the 328 mb 4.5.2 .NET Framework on the link below.

CONNECTING MySQL to VISUAL STUDIO PHASE
1. After all those components are installed, in VS, go to Solution Explorer > Properties > Add Reference > Search for "MySQL.Data."
	a. If you cannot see a "MySql.Data" on the choices, that means that MySQL Connector is not successfully installed.
	b. You should now see a "MySql.Data" listed under the "References" section.
	c. Right-click tha reference and go to Properties > Copy Local and set it to true. 
	d. Copy Local Property means that the dll will be copied on the system every time the user runs it so that other collaborators would not have to download it anymore.
	
2. Open up your MySQL Workbench and create a connection.
3. In VS, go to Server Explorer then Right Click Data Connections > Add Connection
	a. The Data source should be MySQL Database. Again, if you don't see it there that means that your MySQL for Visual Studio installation failed. Go to #3 link again.
	b. Enter the server name as localhost or 127.0.0.1, the username for the connection which is root by default and the password is 1234
		"server=localhost;user id=root;password=1234;database=fireon"
		i.	server=localhost
		ii.	user id=root
		iii.	password=1234
		iv.	database=fireon
	c. Click Test Connection below, it should say connection successful.
	d. Then click on the Database name combobox, and you should see the database you created in MySQL Workbench a while ago.
	e. Click ok then done.
	f. Import the database.
